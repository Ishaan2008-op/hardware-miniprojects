# Hardware Mini-Projects

A collection of small hardware/embedded mini-projects (circuits, sensor builds, and microcontroller code). This repository is a work-in-progress and will grow over time.

## Projects

### 1) Sleep Detector (PIR Sensor)
Detects motion/inactivity using a PIR sensor. Includes documentation, a Tinkercad design image, and the microcontroller code.

**Files**
- `code for sleep detector` — source code
- `sleep detection using pir sensor.pdf` — project write-up
- `tinkercad sleep detetctor design.png` — circuit/design image

### 2) Automatic Gas Sense Exit System
Prototype logic for detecting gas leakage and triggering an alert/exit mechanism.

**Files**
- `automatic gas sense exit system` — project notes/code

## How to use

1. Open a project file/folder from the list above.
2. Read the PDF/design assets (if included).
3. Upload/run the code on your target board (Arduino/ESP32/etc.) after setting the correct pins and libraries.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you add a new mini-project, please include:
- a short description
- wiring/circuit diagram or photo (if possible)
- code + instructions
